	* R/ms_funs.r (plot.rate.mslayout.rad): Add draw.empty argument.

2012-02-12  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	density versions based on the number of electrodes.

	* R/iit.R (make.iit.layout): Switch back to using "mealayout" for
	the class.

	required for the sql writer.  Change column numbers also to "x"
	and "y" in the pos array.

2011-06-09  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* R/episode.detection.R (episode.detection): When there are no
	episodes, return the NULL object.

2011-05-23  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* R/feller.R (feller.spiketimes): Add check to prevent multiple
	files with same electrode/cell name being added.  This was
	happening with some recordings where e.g. both control and drug
	conditions were kept in the same folder; the fix was to put
	these conditions into their own folders.

2011-04-02  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* R/iit.R (iit.read.spikes): Update sampling rate from 7800 Hz to

2010-12-02  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* R/sql.R (make.sql.file): Add a new column, id, to the neuron
	table.  This is used in the spikes table, rather than neuron.name,
	as neuron.name is a character, rather than a short array.  This
	is more efficient for Keith's programme cyclone.

2010-12-01  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* R/sql.R (make.sql.file): Remove duplicate rows from electrode
	table.
	

2010-11-26  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* R/sql.R (make.sql.file): Rename 'num' to 'name' in table
	'neuron', as the name can be alphabetical, not just numeric.

	layout.  Ensure that x,y dimensions are integers for electrode

	layout.

2010-10-19  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	argument so that NA can be used when plotting spike trains.


	* R/litke.R (litke.read.spikes): Add a specific distance break
	just for neurons with distance 0 between them.


	* R/ms_funs.r (plot.mm.s): Cope with NA being used for a channel
	name, in which case just add some whitespace rather than a spike train.

	* R/ncl_mea.R (ncl.read.spikes): Use channel names as the names
	for the elements of 'spikes', so that they can be used when
	plotting spike trains.

2010-08-27  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* R/ms_funs.r (make.movieframes): delete.first argument is now
	TRUE by default.  New clean.after argument to remove temporary
	frames if the animation has been made.


2010-06-24  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* R/litke.R (make.litke1.layout): Include electrode number in
	layout information, so that we can count the number of distinct
	electrodes that recorded activity.

2010-06-15  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* src/sjemea.c (frate): New function to compute firing rate.

	* R/ms_funs.r (make.spikes.to.frate): New version that uses C to
	do all of the binning of spikes for estimating firing rate.
	(make.spikes.to.frate.old): Old version is still here.
	Differences between the two versions are very minor.
	(fourplot): Don't attempt to plot correlation index if it is not
	there.
	

	* R/litke.R (mat.to.rda): New functions to convert MAT files to
	Rda files.  (matlab files are currently slow to read in, whereas
	the equivlane Rda files are fast.)
	(readMatRda): New function: wrapper around readMat() to check
	first if the Rda file has been created.

2010-06-11  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* R/ms_funs.r (spikes.to.rates): Use new method for computing

	index calculations.

	* src/sjemea.c (count_overlap_arr): New function.  Take all of the
	spike trains (as one long vector), and do all pairwise counts of
	overlaps.  When you have many spike trains (e.g. 500+), this is
	much faster than looping in C.

	* R/corr_index.R (make.distances): Rewrite to vectorize, as it is
	slow with large numbers of N (e.g. N > 500).  Typical 10-20 time
	speed up; see test function make.distances.check().
	(corr.get.means.old): Old version was too slow also for N>500.
	e.g with N=979, corr.get.means was taking 40s; this new version
	takes only 0.8s.  split() is our friend here!!!
	(corr.get.means.check): Tester function.
	(corr.get.means): New version.

2010-03-13  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

2009-10-06  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* R/corr_index.R (corr.index): Add min.rate argument.
	(make.corr.indexes): Use min.rate -- now we can introduce NA into

	min.rate. 
	(corr.index.means): Old function? no longer used.
	(corr.get.means): Check for any NA in correlation indices when
	computing mean/sd at each distance.

2009-09-24  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* R/iit.R (iit.read.spikes): Handle the case when FILENAME is a

	large .mat files are not read on a windows machine.

2009-09-22  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* R/ms_funs.r (make.movieframes): Create output directory if it
	doesn't exist.

	* R/iit.R: New file to store code for high-density array (64x64).

	required for processing these data.

	* R/ms_funs.r (spikes.to.ragged.csv): New function.


2009-08-14  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	positions relative to original units.

	(fourplot): Add optional log="" part in call to plot.corr.index.
	Do not add another title to the correlation plot.
	(jay.read.spikes): Compute corr indexes only if there is more than
	one spike train -- otherwise we do not have any cells pairs to compare!
	(jay.read.spikes): Time.interval (for calculating firing
	rates) is now an optional argument.

2002-06-04  Stephen Eglen  <eglen@thalamus.wustl.edu>

	* R/ms_funs.r (plot.mscom): Use square plotting region.
	(show.movie): Provide sensible defaults for beginning and end times.
	(make.spikes.to.frate): Remove the last time break -- so that
	first dimension of rates and times are the same length.
	(rates.to.radii.prop.rad): New function.
	(rates.to.radii): New function.
	(rates.to.radii.prop.area): New function.
	(plot.rate.mslayout): Add options SHOW.COM and SKIP.EMPTY.
	Use rates.to.radii to compute the radius, given firing rate.
	(plot.rate.mslayout.scale): New function to draw "scale bar" for
	converting firing rate to radius.

2002-05-15  Stephen Eglen  <eglen@thalamus.wustl.edu>

	* R/ms_funs.r (plot.rate.mslayout): New version of plot.

2002-05-14  Stephen Eglen  <eglen@thalamus.wustl.edu>

	* R/ms_funs.r (centre.of.mass): New function.  Need to check that
	it is working fine.
	(draw.spikes): new function to draw one spike train.
	(xcorr.restricted): New function to compute cross-correlations
	over just a narrow region of time.
	(xcorr.plot): Check also for windows terminal.

2002-03-10  Stephen Eglen  <eglen@thalamus.wustl.edu>

	* R/ms_funs.r (make.corr.indexes): Use as.double() to prevent
	"integer overflow" errors when both n1, n2 were large.  (in these
	cases, results was NA, so we also check to see that NA is not
	found in the correlation matrix.

2002-03-08  Stephen Eglen  <eglen@thalamus.wustl.edu>

	* R/ms_funs.r (make.mi): Make tmax an argument, so that we can
	test multiple values of tmax.

2002-02-26  Stephen Eglen  <eglen@thalamus.wustl.edu>

	* R/ms_funs.r (plot.mm.s): Rewrite to use segments(), not lines().
	By default do not label cells.  Allow min time to be greater than 0.
	(jay.read.spikes): Ignore spike times less than min.time and
	greater than max.time, if those arguments set.
	(jay.filter.for.max): New function.
	(jay.filter.for.min): New function.
	(make.corr.indexes): Tmax should really be the time of the last
	spike - time of first spike.
	(make.spikes.to.frate): time.low defaults to the time of the first
	spike stored.

2002-02-15  Stephen Eglen  <eglen@thalamus.wustl.edu>

	* R/ms_funs.r (jay.read.spikes): Add parameter IDS so that only
	certain channels can be processed.

2002-02-11  Stephen Eglen  <eglen@thalamus.wustl.edu>

	* R/ms_funs.r (xcorr.plot): Allow plot to display as well as to
	postscript/pdf.
	(crosscorrplots): delete autocorrplots and generalise
	crosscorrplots to make auto-corrs as well.

	* src/sjemea.c (bin_overlap, bin2_overlap): remove unwanted
	variable count.

	* R/ms_funs.r (crosscorrplots): New function to display both auto
	and cross-correlograms.

2002-01-27  Stephen Eglen  <eglen@thalamus.wustl.edu>

	* ms_funs.r (prob.t.cond.r): Check that each histogram has at
	least one entry; else we will divide by zero when normalising 
	the histogram, leading to NA values.
	(read.ms.mm.data.format1): Check that the number of spikes for a
	cell (for each record) is greater than zero.  Previously assumed
	that there would always be at least one spike per cell (per
	record).

2002-01-24  Stephen Eglen  <eglen@thalamus.wustl.edu>

	* ms_funs.r (fuzz.zero): Remove, and use all.equal() instead.

	* ms_funs.r (bin.distances): New function to bin distances.
	(my.upper): New function to return upper triangular elements of matrix.
	(make.mi): Compute the various distributions for mutual
	information, and return as a list.
	Various clean ups to code.
